This is a small tool to create (and update) an offline database of some
"interesting"ยน Steam data.

*WARNING*: This is mostly a playground and not a good example for good code or
coherent project structure.


ยน This is based on the authors interpretation of "interesting" - If you find
something missing, feel free to send a PR to add stuff.
